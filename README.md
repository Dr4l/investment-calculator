## How to Build and Run

### Using Maven

1. **Clone or download the project**
   ```bash
   cd investment-calculator
   ```

2. **Compile the project**
   ```bash
   mvn clean compile
   ```

3. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   mvn test
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.investmentcalc.InvestmentCalculator"
   ```

5. **Create executable JAR**
   ```bash
   mvn clean package
   java -jar target/investment-calculator-1.0.0.jar
   ```

### Direct Java Execution

If you have all dependencies in your classpath:
```bash
javac -cp "lib/*" src/main/java/com/investmentcalc/*.java
java -cp "src/main/java:lib/*" com.investmentcalc.InvestmentCalculator
```

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive automated tests that validate:

- **Simple compound interest calculations** against known mathematical formulas
- **Different compounding frequencies** (daily vs monthly vs annual)
- **Contribution handling** with both positive and negative amounts
- **Edge cases** and precision requirements

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests with detailed output
mvn test

# Run tests with verbose logging
mvn test -X

# Run specific test class
mvn test -Dtest=FinalInvestmentEngineTest
```

### Continuous Integration

The project uses GitHub Actions for automated testing on every push and pull request. See `.github/workflows/test.yml` for the CI configuration.

## A Note on Calculation Differences

You may notice that different online investment calculators provide slightly different results for the same inputs. This is not usually an error, but a result of different assumptions, especially when contribution frequency (e.g., monthly) does not match the compounding frequency (e.g., annually).

Calculators must decide when the contributions start earning interest. Common models include:

- **Beginning of Period**: Contributions earn interest for the full compounding period.
- **End of Period**: Contributions only start earning interest in the next period.
- **Average Contribution**: A hybrid model that approximates the effect of contributions made throughout the period.

This calculator uses a **Beginning of Period** model when "Beginning of Period" is selected, and **End of Period** when "End of Period" is selected in the contribution timing dropdown.

For a detailed breakdown of these models and why discrepancies appear, please see the [Calculation Discrepancies Documentation](docs/calculation-discrepancies.md).

## Technical Details

- **Compound Interest Formula**: Uses the standard compound interest formula with periodic contributions
- **Precision**: Uses BigDecimal with 10 decimal places for financial calculations to avoid floating-point errors
- **Charting**: JFreeChart provides interactive zooming and tooltips
- **GUI Framework**: Swing with modern FlatLaf styling
- **Architecture**: Clean separation between calculation logic and presentation layer
- **Testing**: JUnit 5 with comprehensive test coverage including edge cases

## Customization

You can easily modify the application by:
- Changing the default values in the input fields
- Adding new compounding frequencies in the engine
- Customizing chart colors and styles in the chart panel classes
- Modifying the GUI layout in InvestmentCalculator.java
- Adding new test cases in the test suite
