# Calculation Discrepancies Between Investment Calculators

## Overview

Different online investment calculators often produce varying results for identical inputs. This document explains why these discrepancies occur and how this calculator handles different scenarios.

## Common Sources of Discrepancies

### 1. Contribution Timing Models

When contribution frequency differs from compounding frequency, calculators must make assumptions about when contributions start earning interest.

#### Beginning of Period Model
- Contributions are made at the start of each compounding period
- They earn interest for the full period
- **Example**: Monthly contributions with annual compounding - contributions made in January earn interest for the full year

#### End of Period Model  
- Contributions are made at the end of each compounding period
- They don't earn interest until the next period begins
- **Example**: Monthly contributions with annual compounding - contributions made throughout the year only start earning interest the following year

#### Average/Mid-Period Model
- Assumes contributions are made evenly throughout the period
- Uses an average interest rate calculation
- **Example**: Treats monthly contributions as if made halfway through each period

### 2. Compounding Frequency Assumptions

#### Daily Compounding
- Some calculators use 365 days, others 360 days
- Weekend and holiday handling varies
- **This calculator uses**: 365 days per year

#### Monthly Compounding
- Some use exact months (28-31 days), others assume 30 days
- **This calculator uses**: 12 equal periods per year

### 3. Precision and Rounding

#### Calculation Precision
- Different calculators use varying decimal precision
- **This calculator uses**: 10 decimal places during calculations, rounds to 2 for display

#### Rounding Methods
- Some round after each calculation step
- Others maintain precision throughout and round only at the end
- **This calculator**: Maintains high precision throughout, rounds final results

### 4. Leap Year Handling

- Daily compounding calculators handle leap years differently
- Some ignore leap years, others account for 366 days
- **This calculator**: Uses 365 days consistently for simplicity

## Examples of Discrepancies

### Example 1: Monthly Contributions, Annual Compounding

**Scenario**: $10,000 starting, $1,000 monthly contributions, 7% annual return, 1 year

| Model | Year-End Balance | Explanation |
|-------|------------------|-------------|
| Beginning of Period | $23,700 | All contributions earn 7% for full year |
| End of Period | $22,140 | Contributions don't earn interest until next year |
| Mid-Period Average | ~$22,920 | Weighted average of the above |

### Example 2: Daily vs Monthly Compounding

**Scenario**: $10,000 starting, no contributions, 6% annual return, 1 year

| Frequency | Year-End Balance | Formula |
|-----------|------------------|---------|
| Annual | $10,600.00 | 10,000 × (1.06)¹ |
| Monthly | $10,616.78 | 10,000 × (1.005)¹² |
| Daily | $10,618.31 | 10,000 × (1.000164)³⁶⁵ |

## How This Calculator Works

### Contribution Timing
- **User Selectable**: Choose between "Beginning of Period" or "End of Period"
- **Clear Labels**: Interface clearly indicates which model is being used
- **Consistent Application**: The selected model is applied consistently throughout all calculations

### Compounding Implementation
- **True Compound Interest**: Interest is calculated and added to principal at the specified frequency
- **No Approximations**: Each compounding period is calculated individually
- **High Precision**: Uses BigDecimal arithmetic to avoid floating-point errors

### Validation Through Testing
Our automated test suite validates calculations against:
- Known mathematical formulas
- Hand-calculated examples
- Cross-verification with multiple authoritative sources

## Comparing Results

When comparing this calculator with others:

1. **Check the contribution timing model** - This is the most common source of discrepancies
2. **Verify compounding assumptions** - Ensure both calculators use the same compounding method
3. **Consider precision differences** - Small variations (< $1) are often due to rounding
4. **Look for leap year handling** - Can affect daily compounding calculations

## Recommendations

For the most accurate results:
- **Use monthly compounding** for investments that compound monthly (most savings accounts, CDs)
- **Use annual compounding** for investments that compound annually (some bonds, certain accounts)
- **Select appropriate contribution timing** based on when you actually make contributions
- **Verify assumptions** when comparing with other calculators
